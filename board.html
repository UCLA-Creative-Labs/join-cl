		  <h2><b>How We Recruit Board Members</b>
		  </h2>
		  <p class="space">
		    Creative Labs’ Board Recruitment is rolling and always going on! Members can potentially even
		    join over the summer, as some of our Board Members have. We’ve also recently welcomed a few
		    newcomers onto the team, and we hope this post helps define how you can join the Creative Labs’
		    team and what our team does.
		  </p>

		  <h3>
		    What does “board member” mean?
		  </h3>
		  <p class="space">
		    A board member supports the general operations of Creative Labs. While we do work on cool
		    projects, e.g. web apps, games, redesigns, our board is often working to improve the experience
		    for the general member of Creative Labs. We work on many of these projects internally, and
			often, they’re for the greater CL community—<a href="https://dinner.creativelabsucla.com/" target="_blank">see Dinner</a>. 
			Some projects include finding sponsors
		    for cloud providers, putting on events such as designathons, or building out kick ass web apps
		    like <a href="https://agora.creativelabsucla.com/" target="_blank">Agora</a>.
		  </p>

		  <h3>
		    Online Applications
		  </h3>
		  <p class="space">
		    The online application is the first step to becoming a Board Member. For the majority, the
		    application is meant to measure if you have an idea that might make Creative Labs, as a whole
		    and as a community, better. Do you want to improve the organization? Do you see us as creatives?
		    Entrepreneurs? Devs? Designers? What’s your take on who we are and what we aim to do? It’s
			important to note that factors like major or even portfolio aren’t always important. 
		</p>

		<p class="space">
			Yes, to apply to the design team, you should probably have a couple of graphics up your sleeve. 
			But we take team members of all levels of skill, as long as they show a passion for creativity and a
		    willingness to grow and learn alongside us. At the end of the day, we do a lot of “one week
		    builds” where we learn a technology or process on the spot and scramble to make something
		    wonderful. But we’ve also taken people from other majors (we have an EE major on our
		    marketing/external team) and people who want to start anew in a different area than they’ve
			previously worked in. 
		</p>

		<p class="space">
			We also hope that through your online application shows us a part of who
		    you are. CL is two things: the cool projects we make and the vibrant people that make up our
		    community. You’ll see below a couple of the things we take into account most when filtering
		    through applicants.
		</p>

		  <h3>
		    Interview
		  </h3>
		  <p class="space">
			For each team that chooses your online application, you’ll have an interview. These interviews are 
			separate and tailored to the team. The design team might go over your ability to create graphics quickly 
			or your ideas and concepts for a brand. Marketing and external might look out for your copy skills or any 
			ideas you have to grow our community and create interactions and engagement. Projects will look at your 
			ability to work with different groups of people and manage teams and conflict through mediation and scheduling. 
			Developers will evaluate your ideas and technical ability.
		</p>
			<p class="space">Each of these interviews will look at both you as a person and you as whichever position you’ve selected, 
			whether it be designer, developer, marketer, or project manager.</p>
			
		<p class="space">At the end of the day though, we’re all looking for the same thing. We’re looking for the things that matter most.</p>

		  <h3>
		    What Matters Most
		  </h3>
		  <p class="space"><b>~vibes~ are king. </b></p>
		  <p class="space">
		    Team cohesion is very important to us. The best potential additions to our fam have a
		    willingness to work with others, even in areas you might not be the most skilled in. We juggle a
		    variety of projects constantly, from community management, project management, multiple website
		    designs, and partnership or sponsorship proposals. It’s necessary as a CL team member to value
		    your own and each other’s input on any topic. <b>What matters most is we’re family.</b>
		  </p>
		  <p class="space2"><b>Effort is always rewarded.</b></p>
		  <p class="space">
		    Even freshmen can join our team! Some of our board members haven’t been on CL projects or were
			only accepted to or led a CL project after they became board members. 
		</p>
			<p>We have questions that ask
				about your knowledge of CL on our written app (and of course, we’ll ask similar questions during
				your interview) and even if you have zero experience in CL, as long as you’ve tried to do your
				research (via reaching out to CL members, attending general meeting, or even just poking around
				our site and proposing improvements), you’ll have a better chance at making an impression on our
				team. <b>What matters most is that you try.</b></p>
		
		  <p class="space2"><b>Do it ~for you~</b></p>
		  <p class="space">
		    As a team, we build out our products and projects not for the goal of founding some start up in
		    the future and sometimes, not even for our own benefit. We do it for the community and just
		    because we think it might be a cool thing to build out. Sometimes, we’ll have a video game
		    social and a board member will go on a tangent about how much they want to make a puzzle
		    game—<a href="https://password.creativelabsucla.com/" target="_blank">see Password</a>. Or, a board member will post a cool AR project their friend made… Inevitably,
		    the gears start spinning and we build something just for the sake of building something.
		    <b>What matters most is we create.</b>
